## Hardware
Alfred's strength lies in its hardware:
- 4 Digital servo motors "rohs"
- Adafruit Featherwing Relay switch
- 5v Vacuum Pump & Solenoid valve
- HM-10 BLE 4.0 
- Arduino Braccio Servo Shield 
- Arduino Uno 
- On/off switch

## Design 
This project was inspired and designed with components from an Arduino Braccio servo robot kit. Shortly after assembling the kit, I decided to start designing my own robot in Autodesk Fusion 360. I had salvaged the digital servos, Arduino Uno and Braccio servo shield to be used for prototyping my own robot, Alfred.
